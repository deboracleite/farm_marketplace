# Convert Layout [![Build Status][ci-img]][ci]

A JavaScript library to convert text from one keyboard layout to other.

Useful to prevent errors on english-only fields, like a credit card owner field.

## Usage

There are two ways to load a keyboard layout definition.
If you plan on using a single layout, just load the file directly:

```js
var ru = require('convert-layout/ru');
```

Also you can get a object with all layouts:

```js
var layouts = require('convert-layout');
layout = layouts[name];
```

Every layout has `fromEn` and `toEn` methods:

```js
ru.toEn('руддщ')    //=> "hello"
ru.fromEn('ghbdtn') //=> "привет"
```

## Layouts

Currently supported keyboard layouts:

* Belarusian
* English (QWERTY)
* German
* Kazakh
* Russian
* Spanish
* Ukrainian

If you want to add a new keyboard layout definition:

1. Fork a project. Create a branch.
2. Add a `CODE.js` file with layout buttons map. See example in `ru.js`.
   Lower case letters will be converted to upper case automatically.
   However, all non-letters symbols should be added both
   in uppercase and lowercase.
3. Add `CODE` key to `index.js`.
4. Add layout to the list above.
5. Send a pull request.
